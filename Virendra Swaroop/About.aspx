                                            The Virendra Swarup Educational Foundation, founded by the late Dr. Nagendra Swarup in 1989 as a tribute to his father, Dr. Virendra Swarup, is a testament to the educational legacy established by his visionary father. Dr. Nagendra Swarup, an equally eminent luminary, zealously continued the mission of providing high-quality education to the underprivileged in the less developed regions of Kanpur and its environs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Virendra Swarup Educational Foundation’s journey began in 1990 when the inaugural branch of the Foundation was established in Kidwai Nagar, Kanpur. This initiative was particularly significant as, at that time, only one other school served the area. Consequently, it proved to be a boon for the children of Kidwai Nagar and nearby regions, eliminating the need for them to travel across the city for quality education and alleviating the associated financial burden.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            After the inception of the flagship school in Kidwai Nagar, Dr. Nagendra Swarup successfully established 9 more schools, including a pre-primary and a primary school, in far flung areas of Kanpur, Unnao, and Farrukhabad.  These institutions strategically targeted areas with a genuine demand for high-calibre educational facilities. Notably, the branch established in Panki in 2001 was founded with the same guiding principles of addressing the lack of reputable educational institutions in such locales.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Under Virendra Swarup Education Foundation, Virendra Swarup Institute of Computer Studies, was launched in 1998. It holds the distinction of being the inaugural self-financed institute in Kanpur dedicated to offering computer education through its MCA program. The institute has earned recognition for its commitment to quality education, as evidenced by its ISO 9001:2000 certification. Its MCA, MBA, BCA, and BBA programs are meticulously crafted to cultivate top-tier talent in the fields of Information Technology and Management.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Virendra Swarup Institute of Professional Studies, established in 2005, is dedicated to providing quality education to cultivate exceptional computer and management professionals who, in turn, will contribute to building a robust society in the future.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The Foundation is unwavering in its commitment to being acknowledged as a center for educational excellence, addressing the varied needs of the community. Its goal is to produce highly capable technocrats and managers equipped with extensive knowledge, analytical skills, and interpersonal abilities essential for addressing challenges on a global scale.

In order to courageously face the uncertainties of life we offer an environment conducive to their growth.

Instead of leading a self-centred existence, we involve them in serving the less fortunate so that they develop into compassionate, discerning individuals who while being competitive never lose sight of how there is no true growth unless the world they live in becomes a better place.
